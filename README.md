# hello-world

# This is my following of the tutorial for GitHub. I do Python coding and am learning how to use GitHub as well so that it increases my employability. My goal is to build a portfolio here and then ultimately be able to work from home and spend more time with the family. 

print('Can I code Python here or is this not an IDE? I usually use PyCharm.')
